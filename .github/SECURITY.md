# Our security policy

Safety and security are critical and of the utmost priority to us. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our codebase, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

## Reporting security issues:
We request you **NOT** do disclose any security-related information using GitHub issues, instead, send us an email at [drabkirn@cdadityang.xyz](mailto:drabkirn@cdadityang.xyz), and we'll get back to you as soon as possible(ASAP) and keep updating you throughout the patching process.

We're committed to working for open-source and free software, so we'll not be able to reward you for reporting security vulnerabilities. However, If you choose, after patching the security issue submitted by you, we'll credit you publicly on our website for your efforts.

We're looking forward to accepting your contributions and make this world a better place. Please keep them coming. ‚ù§üíñ
